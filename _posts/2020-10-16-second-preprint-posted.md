The consortium has published its second preprint on medRxiv entitled "Validation of a Derived International Patient Severity Phenotype to Support COVID-19 Analytics from Electronic Health Record Data". The manuscript develops and validates an algorithm for detecting COVID-19 patients with severe disease from readily accessible EHR data across the Consortium. It was resilient to data differences internationally by building on six clinical code classes. This algorithm was validated at 12 international sites.

The consortium has published a preprint describing the results of the first phase of its efforts on medRxiv. Titled "International Electronic Health Record-Derived COVID-19 Clinical Course Profile: The 4CE Consortium", the manuscript covers the consortium's data collection process and findings on EHR data from 96 hospitals in the US, France, Italy, Germany, and Singapore. These hospitals contributed data to the consortium for a total of 27,927 COVID-19 cases and 187,802 performed laboratory values.
